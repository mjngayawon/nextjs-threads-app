# 💻 Threads Clone

This project is a full stack **Threads clone** built using **Next.js 14+**, featuring a fully redesigned user interface inspired by a custom Figma design. It was created as a **personal learning initiative** to strengthen my knowledge and skills in backend development, while also exploring advanced full stack concepts.

The application replicates core social media functionality, including **user authentication**, **community-based interactions**, and a **robust thread system**. Key features include **nested deep comments** to support complex discussions, a **real-time search experience**, and a **notification system** to enhance user engagement. From seamless user experience on the frontend to efficient data handling and server-side logic on the backend, this project showcases the integration of modern web technologies and development practices.
